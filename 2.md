# Chapter 2: Basic Cocos2d-x Concepts

## Scene Graph
A `Scene Graph` is a data structure that arranges a graphical scene. A `Scene Graph` contains `Nodes` in a tree structure.

As the `Scene Graph` is a tree you can walk the tree. Cocos2d'x uses the `in-order walk` algorithm. A `in-order walk` is the left side of the tree being walked, then the root node, then the right side of the tree.

## Director
Cocos2d-x uses the concept of a `Director`. Yes, just like in a movie! The `Director` makes decisions and tells the necessary recipient what to do. One common `Director` task is to control `Scene` replacements and transitions. The `Director` also controls the scale factor. The `Director` is a shared singleton object that you can call from anywhere in your code. It also takes care of the OpenGL initialization process.

## Actions
Another integral part of Cocos2d-x is `Actions`. `Actions` allow the transformation of `Nodes` in time space. Want to move a `Sprite` from one `Point` to another and use a callback when complete? No problem! You can even create a `Sequence` of `Actions` to be performed on a `Node`. Example Actions: `MoveBy`, `Rotate`, `Scale.`

## Parent Child Relationship
Cocos2d-x uses a `Parent and Child` relationship. This means that properties and changes to the parent node are applied to its children. Example: If you rotate a parent node, the children also rotate.
