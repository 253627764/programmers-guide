# Chapter 8: Other Node Types

## TMX and Fast TMX
TMX is an XML-based map format originally designed for tile-based maps but
meanwhile also suitable for more generic game levels due to its support
for various object types. Tile-based maps can have many layers, determined by a z-order. Each tile has a unique position and id.

```cpp
// reading in a tiled map.
cocos2d::TMXTiledMap* map = cocos2d::TMXTiledMap::create("TileMap.tmx");
addChild(map, 0, kTagTileMap);

// how to get a specific layer and tile
auto layer = map->layerNamed("Layer 0");
auto tile = layer->tileAt(cocos2d::Vec2(1, 63));

// to obtain a specific tiles id
unsigned int gid = layer->tileGIDAt(cocos2d::Vec2(0, 63));
```

## Particle
    
## Parallax
A `Parallax` Node is a special `Node` type that simulates a parallax scroller. You can think of many games that function this way, Super Mario Bros being a classic example.
```cpp

```

## Video (Experimental)
Video playback is supported as an experimental feature. The format of the video is dependent upon the formats the players operating system supports. This feature is currently experimental since it only works for iOS and Android.
```cpp
// play a video from a URL
auto videoPlayer = cocos2d::experimental::ui::VideoPlayer::create();
videoPlayer->setContentSize(Size(x,y));
videoPlayer->setURL("http://example.com/video.mp4");  
videoPlayer->play();

// play a video from a local file
auto videoPlayer = cocos2d::experimental::ui::VideoPlayer::create();
videoPlayer->setContentSize(Size(x,y));
videoPlayer->setFileName("filepath/video.mp4");
videoPlayer->play();
```
