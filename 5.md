# Chapter 5: Building and Transitioning Scenes

## What is a Scene?
A `Scene` is a container that holds `Sprites`, `Layers` and other rendered content. A `Scene` is responsible for running game logic and rendering the content on a per-frame basis. 

## Creating a Scene
It is very easy to create a `Scene`
```cpp
// create a simple scene
cocos2d::Scene* myScene = cocos2d::Scene::create();

// create a simple scene with physics
cocos2d::Scene* scene = cocos2d::Scene::createWithPhysics();
```

### Creating a Node Tree
A `Node` tree controls the draw order of GUI elements. This might also be referred to as `scene graph priority`. The important thing to remember is that this defines the drawing order of the GUI elements, starting first to last.

A simple `Node` tree laid out in code:
```cpp
// create a simple scene
cocos2d::Scene* myScene = cocos2d::Scene::create();

// create a simple layer
cocos2d::Layer* myLayer = cocos2d::Layer::create();

// a few Sprites
cocos2d::Sprite* sprite1 = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite.png");
cocos2d::Sprite* sprite2 = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite.png");
cocos2d::Sprite* sprite3 = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite.png");

// a few more Sprites
cocos2d::Sprite* spriteA = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite2.png");
cocos2d::Sprite* spriteB = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite2.png");
cocos2d::Sprite* spriteC = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite2.png");

sprite1->addChild(spriteA); // spriteA is now a child of sprite1
sprite2->addChild(spriteB); // spriteB is now a child of sprite2
sprite3->addChild(spriteC); // spriteC is not a child of sprite3

myLayer->addChild(sprite1); // sprite1 is now a child of myLayer
myLayer->addChild(sprite2); // sprite2 is now a child of myLayer
myLayer->addChild(sprite3); // sprite3 is now a child of myLayer

myScene->addChild(myLayer); // myLayer is not a child of myScene
``` 
### Node properties to its descendants
An important thing to remember is that properties applied to `Node` are cascaded down to its children.     

## Coordinate Systems
We all know about coordinate systems from various school math classes. 
        
### Converting between coordinate systems
    
## Transitioning between Scenes
You might need to move beween `Scenes` in your game. Perhaps starting a new game, changing levels or even ending your game. Cocos2d-x provides a number of ways to do `Scene Transitions`.
