# Chapter 6: Building and Transitioning Scenes

## What is a Scene?
A `Scene` is a container that holds `Sprites`, `Layers` and other rendered content. A `Scene` is responsible for running game logic and rendering the content on a per-frame basis. 

## Creating a Scene
It is very easy to create a `Scene`
```cpp
// create a simple scene
cocos2d::Scene* myScene = cocos2d::Scene::create();

// create a simple scene with physics
cocos2d::Scene* scene = cocos2d::Scene::createWithPhysics();
```

### Creating a Node Tree
A `Node` tree controls the draw order of GUI elements. This might also be referred to as `scene graph priority`. The important thing to remember is that this defines the drawing order of the GUI elements, starting first to last.

A simple `Node` tree laid out in code:
```cpp
// create a simple scene
auto myScene = cocos2d::Scene::create();

// create a simple layer
auto myLayer = cocos2d::Layer::create();

// a few Sprites
auto sprite1 = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite.png");
auto sprite2 = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite.png");
auto sprite3 = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite.png");

// a few more Sprites
auto spriteA = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite2.png");
auto spriteB = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite2.png");
auto spriteC = cocos2d::Sprite::create("sprite2.png");

sprite1->addChild(spriteA); // spriteA is now a child of sprite1
sprite2->addChild(spriteB); // spriteB is now a child of sprite2
sprite3->addChild(spriteC); // spriteC is not a child of sprite3

myLayer->addChild(sprite1); // sprite1 is now a child of myLayer
myLayer->addChild(sprite2); // sprite2 is now a child of myLayer
myLayer->addChild(sprite3); // sprite3 is now a child of myLayer

myScene->addChild(myLayer); // myLayer is now a child of myScene
``` 
### Node properties to its descendants
An important thing to remember is that properties applied to `Node` are cascaded down to its children.     

## Coordinate Systems
We all know about coordinate systems from various school math classes. 
        
### Converting between coordinate systems
    
## Transitioning between Scenes
You might need to move between `Scenes` in your game. Perhaps starting a new game, changing levels or even ending your game. Cocos2d-x provides a number of ways to do `Scene Transitions`.

### Ways to transition between Scenes
```cpp
auto myScene = cocos2d::Scene::create();

// runWithScene - use this for the first Scene only
cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->runWithScene(myScene);

// replaceScene - replace a scene outright
cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->replaceScene(myScene);

// pushScene - suspends the execution of the running scene, pushing it on the stack
// of suspended scenes. Only call this if there is a running scene
cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->pushScene(myScene);

// popScene - This scene will replace the running one. The running scene will be
// deleted. Only call this if there is a running scene
cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->popScene(myScene);
```

### Transition Scenes with effects
You can add visual effects to your `Scene` transitions
```cpp
auto myScene = cocos2d::Scene::create();

// Transition Fade
cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->replaceScene(cocos2d::TransitionFade::create(0.5, myScene, cocos2d::Color3B(0,255,255)));

// FlipX
cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->replaceScene( cocos2d::TransitionFlipX::create(2, myScene));

// Transition Slide In
cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->replaceScene( cocos2d::TransitionSlideInT::create(1, myScene) );
```
