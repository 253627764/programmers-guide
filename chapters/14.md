# Chapter  14: Advanced Topics
Wow! You are on the last chapter. Good Job! By now you should feel comfortable
creating your games with Cocos2d-x. However, please realize there is no limit to
what you can create. This chapter covers __advanced__ concepts. Note that this
chapter gets more technical in it's content and format.

# File System Access
Even though you can use functions in `stdio.h` to access files it can be
inconvenient for a few reasons:
* You need to invoke system specific API to get full path of a file.
* Resources are packed into .apk file on Android after installing.
* Want to load a resource(such as a picture) based on resolution automatically.

The `FileUtils` class has been created to resolve these issues. `FileUitls` is a
helper class to access files under `Resources`. This includes reading data from
a file and checking file existence.

### Functions to read file content
These functions will read different type of files and will return different data types:
```
| function name          | return type          | support path type               |
| getStringFromFile      | std::string          | relative path and absolute path |
| getDataFromFile        | cocos2d::Data        | relative path and absolute path |
| getFileDataFromZip     | unsigned char*       | absolute path                   |
| getValueMapFromFile    | cocos2d::ValueMap    | relative path and absolute path |
| getValueVectorFromFile | cocos2d::ValueVector | relative path and absolute path |
```

### Functions to manage files or directories
These functions will manage a file or a directory:
```
| function name         | support path type               |
| isFileExist           | relative path and absolute path |
| isDirectoryExist      | relative path and absolute path |
| createDirectory       | absolute path                   |
| removeDirectory       | absolute path                   |
| removeFile            | absolute path                   |
| renameFile            | absolute path                   |
| getFileSize           | relative path and absolute path |
```

## Best Practice - Optimization, memory, performance, profiling

## SQLite

## Subclass Cocos2d-x classes

## Data structures (i.e Vector)

## Custom OpenGL (what to cover here? CustomCommand?)

## c++11 usage

## rendering pipeline (notes about this in the wiki)

## Networking with HTTP

HTTP networking has three steps
   1. Create an `HttpRequest`
   2. Create a `setResponseCallback()` callback function for replying to requests.
   3. Send `HttpRequest` by `HttpClient`
