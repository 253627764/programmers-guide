# Chapter  14: Advanced Topics
Wow! You are on the last chapter. Good Job! By now you should feel comfortable
creating your games with Cocos2d-x. However, please realize there is no limit to
what you can create. This chapter covers __advanced__ concepts. Note that this
chapter gets more technical in it's content and format.

# File System Access
Even though you can use functions in `stdio.h` to access files it can be
inconvenient for a few reasons:
* You need to invoke system specific API to get full path of a file.
* Resources are packed into .apk file on Android after installing.
* Want to load a resource(such as a picture) based on resolution automatically.

The `FileUtils` class has been created to resolve these issues. `FileUitls` is a
helper class to access files under `Resources`. This includes reading data from
a file and checking file existence.

### Functions to read file content
These functions will read different type of files and will return different data types:
```
| function name          | return type          | support path type               |
| getStringFromFile      | std::string          | relative path and absolute path |
| getDataFromFile        | cocos2d::Data        | relative path and absolute path |
| getFileDataFromZip     | unsigned char*       | absolute path                   |
| getValueMapFromFile    | cocos2d::ValueMap    | relative path and absolute path |
| getValueVectorFromFile | cocos2d::ValueVector | relative path and absolute path |
```

### Functions to manage files or directories
These functions will manage a file or a directory:
```
| function name         | support path type               |
| isFileExist           | relative path and absolute path |
| isDirectoryExist      | relative path and absolute path |
| createDirectory       | absolute path                   |
| removeDirectory       | absolute path                   |
| removeFile            | absolute path                   |
| renameFile            | absolute path                   |
| getFileSize           | relative path and absolute path |
```

# Networking with HTTP
Sometimes it might be helpful to obtain resources or data from another source.
One common way to do this is by using an `HTTP` request.

HTTP networking has three steps:
   1. Create an `HttpRequest`
   2. Create a `setResponseCallback()` callback function for replying to requests.
   3. Send `HttpRequest` by `HttpClient`

`HttpRequest` can have four types:  _POST_, _PUT_, _DELETE_, _UNKNOWN_. Unless
specified the default is _UNKNOWN_. `HTTPClient` controls sending the _request_
and receiving the data on a _callback_.

Working with an `HTTPRequest` is quite simple:
```cpp
HttpRequest* request = new (std :: nothrow) HttpRequest();
request->setUrl("http://just-make-this-request-failed.com");
request->setRequestType(HttpRequest::Type::GET);
request->setResponseCallback(CC_CALLBACK_2 (HttpClientTest::onHttpRequestCompleted, this));

HttpClient::getInstance()->sendImmediate(request);

request->release();
```

Notice that we specified a `setResponseCallback()` method for when a response is
received. By doing this we can look at the data returned and use it how we might
need to. Again, this process is simple and we can do it with ease:
```cpp
void HttpClientTest::onHttpRequestCompleted(HttpClient* sender, HttpResponse* response)
{
  if (!response)
  {
    return;
  }

  // Dump the data
  std::vector<char>* buffer = response->getResponseData();

  for (unsigned int i = 0; i <buffer-> size (); i ++)
  {
    log ("% c", (* buffer) [i]);
  }
}
```
