# Chapter 6: UI

## Overview
Cocos2d-x provides a easy to use `UI` api that takes care of your GUI needs.
Some of these include `Label`, `Menu`, `MenuItems`, `Buttons` and `Views`.

## Label
Cocos2d-x provides a `Label` object that can create TTF, BMFont and SystemFont
labels.

#### Label BMFont
`BMFont` is a label type that uses a bitmap font. Bitmap fonts consist of a
matrix of dots or pixels representing the image of each glyph in each face and
size. It is very fast and easy to use, but not scalable, requiring a separate
font for each size.

As the `Label` class is subclass of `SpriteBatchNode` each character is a `Sprite`
and can be rotated, scaled, tinted, changes in _anchor point_ and most any other
property change derived from a `Node` object.

Creating a `BMFont` label requires two files: a _.fnt_ file and an image
representation of each character in _.png_ format. If you are using a tool like
*_Glyph Designer_* these files are created automatically for you. Creating a
`BMFont` label:
```cpp
auto myLabel = Label::createWithBMFont("myFont.fnt", "My Label Text");
```
All of the characters in the string parameter should be found in the provided
"MyFont.fnt" file, otherwise they won't be rendered. If you render a `Label` and
it is missing characters, make sure they exist in your "MyFont.fnt" file. An
example `Label` created with `BMFont`:

#### Label TTF
`TTF` is a label type that uses a _True Type Font_. To create one you need to
specify a `.ttf` font file name, text string and a size. Unlike `BMFont`, `TTF`
can render size changes without the need for a separate font files. Creating a
`TTF` label:
```cpp
auto myLabel = Label::createWithTTF("myFont.ttf", "My Label Text", 16);
```
Although it is more flexible than `BMFont`, `TTF` is slower and changing
properties like the font face and size is an expensive operation. An example
`Label` created with `TTF`

If you need several `TTF` labels that all have the same properties you can create
a `TTFConfig` object to manage them. A `TTFConfig` allows you to set the properties
that all of your `TTF` labels would have in common. You can create one like:
```cpp
// create a TTFConfig files for labels to share
TTFConfig labelConfig;
labelConfig.fontFilePath = "myFont.ttf";
labelConfig.fontSize = 16;
labelConfig.glyphs = GlyphCollection::DYNAMIC;
labelConfig.outlineSize = 0;
labelConfig.customGlyphs = nullptr.
labelConfig.distanceFieldEnabled = false;

// create a TTF Label from the TTFConfig file.
auto myLabel = Label::createWithTTF(labelConfig, "My Label Text");
```
A `TTFConfig` can also be used for displaying Chinese, Japanese and Korean
characters.

#### Label SystemFont
`SystemFont` is a label type that uses the default system font and font size.
This is a font that is meant not to have its properties changed. You should think
of it as system font, system rules. Creating a `SystemFont` label:
```cpp
auto myLabel = Label::createWithSystemFont("My Label Text", "Arial", 16);
```
## Label Effects and Typesetting
###Label Effects
`Label` objects can have effects applied to them. Not all _label_ types support
all effects. Some effects include _shadow_, _outline_, and _glow_.
```cpp
// shadow effect is supported by all Label types
myLabel->enableShadow();
```
```cpp
// outline effect is TTF only, specify the outline color desired
label->enableOutline(Color4B(100, 50, 100, 100));
```
```cpp
// glow effect is TTF only, specify the glow color desired.
label->enableGlow(Color4B(100, 50, 100, 100));
```

## Menu and Menu Items
A `Menu` is a way to navigate through game options. Menus often contain options
like _Play_, _Quit_, _Settings_ and _About_. This is usually in the form of
buttons that are pressed.

### What makes up a menu
A `Menu` is a special `Node` object. To create an empty `Menu`:
```cpp
auto myMenu = Menu::create();
```

### Menu Items and adding to a Menu
`MenuItems` are the core of any `Menu`.  Menu Items usually have a `normal` and
a `selected` state as well as a callback...something that happens when the
`MenuItem` is selected.
```cpp
// creating a menu with a single item

// create a menu item
auto closeItem = MenuItemImage::create("CloseNormal.png", "CloseSelected.png",
CC_CALLBACK_1(HelloWorld::menuCloseCallback, this));


auto menu = Menu::create(closeItem, NULL);
this->addChild(menu, 1);
```
A menu can also be created by using a `Vector` of `MenuItem` objects:

```cpp
// creating a Menu from a Vector of items
Vector<MenuItem*> MenuItems;

auto closeItem = MenuItemImage::create("CloseNormal.png", "CloseSelected.png",
CC_CALLBACK_1(HelloWorld::menuCloseCallback, this));

MenuItems.pushBack(closeItem);

/* repeat for as many menu items as needed */

auto menu = Menu::createWithArray(MenuItems);
this->addChild(menu, 1);
```

### Lambdas as Menu callback
A _lambda_ function is a function that you can write inline in your source code.
Cocos2d-x makes use of _lambdas_. You can even use them as callbacks! Besides
`Menu` callbacks _lambdas_ can be used for a variety of functions.

A simple _lambda_:
```cpp
auto func = [] () { cout << "Hello world"; };
func(); // now call the function
```
Using a _lambda_ as an `Action`:
```cpp
auto action1 = CallFunc::create([&](){
        std::cout << "using a Lambda callback" << std::endl;
});
```
Creating an _std::function_ using a _lambda_:
```cpp
std::function<void()> myFunction = []()
{
        std::cout << "From myFunction()" << std::endl;
};
auto action2 = CallFunc::create(myFunction);
```
Using a _lambda_ as a `MenuItem` callback:
```cpp
auto closeItem = MenuItemImage::create("CloseNormal.png", "CloseSelected.png",
[&](Ref* sender){
	// your code here
});
```

## GUI Widgets and Containers
### Overview
The new GUI module is a widget-based GUI framework, it was original designed for
use with CocosStudio. The root class of the new GUI module is `ui::Widget` which
is inherited from `ProtectedNode`. A ProtectedNode is designed for holding inner
`Node` list such that when you are adding or removing child node from the
`ProtectedNode`, the "Innder Node List" won't be touched which is safe to keep
widget's inner rendering components. We can break the GUI down into two distinct
pieces: _Widget_ and _Containers_.

### Layout

The `Layout` class is the root class of all containers. It inherits from `Widget`.
The `Layout` class exists mainly for arranging children widgets and clipping.

The `LayoutManager`, `LayoutParameter` and `Margin` classes are used for layout
elements. `HBox`, `VBox` and `RelativeBox` are handy classes for layout children
widgets horizontally, vertically and relatively.

The `ScrolView`, `ListView` and `PageView` are specific containers for certain
usage scenario. We will talk it in another section.

### Widgets
`Widgets` are GUI objets that help make creating a user interface easier. Let's
talk about the common _widgets_ that you might use:

#### Buttons
A button intercepts a touch event and calls a predefined callback when tapped.
It is inherited from `ui::Widget`. This class provide methods for setting the
title, image and other properties of button. A `Button` has a _normal_ and
_selected_ state. The appearance of the `Button` can change based upon this
state. Creating a `Button` is simple:
```cpp
auto button = Button::create("animationbuttonnormal.png",
                             "animationbuttonpressed.png");
button->setTitleText("Text Button");
button->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
button->addTouchEventListener(CC_CALLBACK_2(UIButtonTest::touchEvent, this));
this->addChild(button);
```

#### CheckBox
A `CheckBox` permits the user to make a binary choice. A `Checkbox` can have a
state of _normal_, _selected_ and _disabled_. Creating a `CheckBox` is simple:
```cpp
auto checkBox = CheckBox::create("check_box_normal.png",
                                 "check_box_normal_press.png",
                                 "check_box_active.png",
                                 "check_box_normal_disable.png",
                                 "check_box_active_disable.png");
checkBox->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));

checkBox->addEventListener(CC_CALLBACK_2(UICheckBoxTest::selectedEvent, this));
this->addChild(checkBox);
```

#### LoadingBar
A `LoadingBar` could be used to show the progression of an operation, such as
loading, file transfer, etc. It could also be referred to as a _status bar_.
Creating a `LoadingBar`:
```cpp
auto loadingBar = LoadingBar::create("sliderProgress.png");
loadingBar->setDirection(LoadingBar::Direction::RIGHT);
loadingBar->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(loadingBar);
```

#### Slider
A `Slider` allows user to set value by moving a indicator. To create a `Slider`:
```cpp
auto slider = Slider::create();
slider->loadBarTexture("sliderTrack.png");
slider->loadSlidBallTextures("sliderThumb.png", "sliderThumb.png", "");
slider->loadProgressBarTexture("sliderProgress.png");
slider->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
slider->addEventListener(CC_CALLBACK_2(UISliderTest::sliderEvent, this));
this->addChild(slider);
```

#### ImageView
A `ImageView` is a placeholder for displaying images. It supports touch events,
focus, percent positioning and percent content size. To create an `ImageView`:
```cpp
auto imageView = ImageView::create("ccicon.png");
imageView->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(imageView);
```
It is also possible to create an `ImageView` from a `SpriteFrame`:
```cpp
auto imageView = ImageView::create("ccicon.png", TextureResType::PLIST);
imageView->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(imageView);
```

#### Text
A `Text` widget is used for display text. It can also use it as a _text-only_
button.  `Text` supports system font and TTF fonts. To create a `Text` widget:
```cpp
auto text = Text::create("Text","fonts/MyTTF.ttf",30);
text->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(text);
```
You can add effects like _shadow_, _glow_ and _outline_ just like any `Label`
object.

### TextBMFont
A `TextBMFont` widget is used for displaying `BMFont` text. It supports touch
event, focus, percent positioning and percent content size. Creating a `TextBMFont`
is list like the `Text` widget:
```cpp
auto textBMFont = TextBMFont::create("BMFont", "bitmapFontTest2.fnt");
textBMFont->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(textBMFont);
```

#### TextAtlas
A `TextAtlas` widget is used for displaying text as an _atlas font_. It  supports
touch event, focus, percent positioning and percent content size.\
```cpp
auto textAtlas = TextAtlas::create("1234567890", "labelatlas.png", 17, 22, "0");
textAtlas->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
this->addChild(textAtlas);
```

#### RichText
A `RichText` widget is used for displaying text, image and custom nodes.  It
supports touch event, focus, percent positioning and percent content size. When
receiving a touch event the whole `RichText` widget receives the event. To create
a `RichText` widget:
```cpp
auto richText = RichText::create();
richText->ignoreContentAdaptWithSize(false);
richText->setContentSize(Size(100, 100));

auto re1 = RichElementText::create(1, Color3B::WHITE, 255, str1, "Marker Felt", 10);

richText->pushBackElement(re1);
richText->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
richText->setLocalZOrder(10);
this->addChild(_richText);
```

#### TextField
A `TextField` Widget is used for inputting text. It supports touch event, focus,
percent positioning and percent content size. To create a `TextField` widget:
```cpp
auto textField = TextField::create("input words here","Arial",30);
textField->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));
textField->addEventListener(CC_CALLBACK_2(UITextFieldTest::textFieldEvent, this));
this->addChild(textField);
```

***Ricardo, I removed ScrollView and ListView for now as the coe was very long and
seems very complicated. If we need to include it I should try and create a smaller,
more concise code example. I alro removed `HBox` and `VBox` layout as they were only
described for container purposes, as Owen put it.
