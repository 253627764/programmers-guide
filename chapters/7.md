# Chapter 7: Other Node Types
You are using _sprites_, _labels_, _actions and your game is making progress.
Besides the basic `Node` types described in previous chapters, cocos2d-x also
provides more advanced `Node` types to help build special functionality. Perhaps
you want to make a tile-based game? Or maybe a _2d side scroller_? Or maybe you
want to add particle effects to your game? Cocos2d-x provides `Node` objects to
help you accomplish these goals!

## TMX
`TMX` is an XML-based map format originally designed for tile-based maps but
is also suitable for more generic game levels due to its support
for various object types. `TMX` objects are easy to create:
```cpp
// reading in a tiled map.
auto map = TMXTiledMap::create("TileMap.tmx");
addChild(map, 0, 99); // with a tag of '99'
```

Tile-based maps can have many layers, determined by a
z-order. You can access a specific layer by it's name:
```cpp
// how to get a specific layer
auto map = TMXTiledMap::create("TileMap.tmx");
auto layer = map->layerNamed("Layer 0");
auto tile = layer->tileAt(Vec2(1, 63));
```

Each tile has a unique position and id. This make is very easy to cherry pick
specific tiles. You can access any tile by it's id:
```cpp
// to obtain a specific tiles id
unsigned int gid = layer->tileGIDAt(Vec2(0, 63));
```

Example tiled-map layouts:

![](7-img/tilemap2.png "timemap2")

How do you make a tiled-map? There are many tools that do this. [Tiled](http://mapeditor.org)
is a popular tool. It is actively developed and has a great user community. The
screen-shots above are actual __Tiled__ projects.

## Particle

## Parallax
A `Parallax` Node is a special `Node` type that simulates a _parallax scroller_.
What did you say? A _para_.. what? Yes, _parallax_ Simply put you can consider
a `ParallaxNode` to be a __special effect__ that makes it appear that the position
or direction of an object appears to differ when viewed from different positions.
Simple every day examples include looking through the viewfinder and the lens of
a camera. You can think of many games that function this way, Super Mario Bros
being a classic example. `ParallaxNode` objects can be moved around by a `Sequence`
and  also manually by mouse, touch, accelerometer or keyboard events.

Parallax nodes are a bit more complex than regular nodes. Why? Because they
require the use of multiple nodes to function. A `ParallaxNode` cannot function
by itself. You need at least 2 other `Node` objects to complete a `ParallaxNode`.
As usual, in true Cocos2d-x fashion a `ParallaxNode` is easy to create:
```cpp
// create ParallaxNode
auto paraNode = ParallaxNode::create();
```
Since you need multiple `Node` objects, they too are easily added:
```cpp
// create ParallaxNode
auto paraNode = ParallaxNode::create();

// background image is moved at a ratio of 0.4x, 0.5y
paraNode->addChild(background, -1, Vec2(0.4f,0.5f), Vec2::ZERO);

// tiles are moved at a ratio of 2.2x, 1.0y
paraNode->addChild(tilemap, 1, Vec2(2.2f,1.0f), Vec2(0,-200) );

// top image is moved at a ratio of 3.0x, 2.5y
paraNode->addChild(cocosImage, 2, Vec2(3.0f,2.5f), Vec2(200,800) );
```

OK, looks and feels familiar, right? Notice a few items! Each `Node` object that
was added is given a unique `z-order` so that they stack on top of each other.
Also notice the additional 2 `Vec2` type parameters in the `addChild()` call.
