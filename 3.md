# Chapter 3: Sprite and Nodes

## What are Sprites
A Sprite is a 2D graphic.
     
## Creating Sprites     
        
### Creating a Textured Sprite     
```cpp
cococ2d::Sprite* mySprite = cocos2d::Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```
### Creating an Untextured Sprite
```cpp
cocos2d::Sprite* mySprite = cocos2d::Sprite::create();
```
### Creating a Sprite From a SpriteFrame
```cpp
cocos2d::SpriteFrame* frame = cocos2d::SpriteFrame::createWithTexture(texture, rect, offset);
    
cocos2d::Sprite* mysprite = cocos2d::Sprite::createWithSpriteFrame(frame);
```        
### Creating a Sprite From SpriteCache
```cpp
cocos2d::Sprite* mysprite = cocos2d::Sprite::createWithSpriteFrameName("mysprite.png");
```
### Creating a Sprite From a Rect
```cpp
cococ2d::Sprite* mySprite = cocos2d::Sprite::create("mysprite.png", cocos2d::Rect(0,0,40,40));
```
## Sprite Manipulation
After creating a Sprite, there are a variety of functions that can be applied to it.

Given:
```cpp
cococ2d::Sprite* mySprite = cocos2d::Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```
### Resizing
```cpp
mySprite->setScale(4.0); // increases X and Y size by 4.0 uniformly

mySprite->setScaleX(4.0); // increases just X scale by 4.0

mySprite->setScaleY(4.0); // increases just Y scale by 4.0
```
### Anchor Point and Position    
```cpp
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0.5, 0.5); // middle

mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0, 0); // bottom left
```
    
A few other possible options
```cpp
mySprite->setSkew(4.0); adjusts the X and Y skew by 4.0 uniformly

mySprite->setSkewX(4.0); adjusts the X skew by 4.0

mySprite->setSkewY(4.0); adjusts the Y skew by 4.0
```
## SpriteSheets
A SpriteSheet a way to combine sprites into a single texture while reducing the overall size compared to loading each Sprite individually. 

Load your SpriteSheet, probably in AppDelegate:
```cpp
cocos2d::SpriteFrameCache* _spritecache = cocos2d::SpriteFrameCache::getInstance();
_spritecache->addSpriteFramesWithFile("sprites.plist");
```
A few examples of working with a SpriteSheet:
```cpp

```
