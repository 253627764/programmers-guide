# Chapter 3: Sprites

## What are Sprites
A Sprite is a 2D graphic.

## Creating Sprites     
        
### Creating a Textured Sprite     
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```
### Creating an Untextured Sprite
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create();
```
### Creating a Sprite From a SpriteFrame
```cpp
auto frame = SpriteFrame::createWithTexture(texture, rect, offset);
    
auto mysprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrame(frame);
```        
### Creating a Sprite From SpriteCache
```cpp
auto mysprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrameName("mysprite.png");
```
### Creating a Sprite From a Rect
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png", Rect(0,0,40,40));
```
## Sprite Manipulation
After creating a Sprite, there are a variety of functions that can be applied to it.

Given:
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```
### Resizing
```cpp
mySprite->setScale(4.0); // increases X and Y size by 4.0 uniformly

mySprite->setScaleX(4.0); // increases just X scale by 4.0

mySprite->setScaleY(4.0); // increases just Y scale by 4.0
```
### Anchor Point and Position    
```cpp
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0.5, 0.5); // middle

mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0, 0); // bottom left
```
    
A few other possible options
```cpp
mySprite->setSkew(4.0); adjusts the X and Y skew by 4.0 uniformly

mySprite->setSkewX(4.0); adjusts the X skew by 4.0

mySprite->setSkewY(4.0); adjusts the Y skew by 4.0
```
## Sprite Sheets
A `sprite sheet` a way to combine sprites into a single texture while reducing the overall size compared to loading each Sprite individually. Why does this matter? When loading a `Sprite` each hardware platform has constraints of a minimum texture size that it will need to load. As you can imagine there is a lot of unused space and this increases memory consumption, draw times and lowers your games frame rate. Using a `sprite sheet` allows all of your sprites to be condensed filing unused space. Now only the entire spritesheet must meet the hardwares constraints and can be loaded all at the same time. This means you will significantly reduce memory usage, reduce the time it takes to draw your sprites and keep the frame rate of your game high.

Here is an example sprite sheet:

Load your sprite sheet into the `SpriteFrameCache`, probably in AppDelegate:
```cpp
auto spritecache = SpriteFrameCache::getInstance();
spritecache->addSpriteFramesWithFile("sprites.plist");
```
A few examples of working with a sprite sheet:

Creating a `Sprite` from the `SpriteFrameCache`
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrameName("mysprite.png");
```
Creating an `Animation` from `SpriteFrameCache`
```cpp
auto anim1 = Animation::create();
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemystand.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove1.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove2.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove3.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove4.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove5.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemyjump.png");
  
auto animation = Animate::create(anim1);
animation->setDuration(0.2f);
sprite->runAction(RepeatForever::create(animation));
```
