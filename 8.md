# Chapter 8: Event Dispatcher

## What is the EventDispatch mechanism?
`EventDispatch` is a mechanism for responding to user events.

The basics:

* Event listeners encapsulate your event processing code.
* Event dispatcher notifies listeners of user events.
* Event objects contain information about the event.

## 5 types of event listeners.
         
`EventListenerTouch` - responds to touch events
             
         
`EventListenerKeyboard` - responds to keyboard events
         
`EventListenerAcceleration` - responds to accelerometer events    
        
`EventListenMouse` - responds to mouse events
         
`EventListenerCustom` - responds to custom events
